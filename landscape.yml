            description: >-
              The CoMPAS project was formed as the first project in LF Energy’s Digital Substation Automation Systems (DSAS) initiative. The primary goal of the
              CoMPAS project is to develop open source software components related to IEC 61850 model implementation, specifically for profile management and
              configuration of a power industry Protection Automation and Control System (PACS).


              CoMPAS (Configuration Modules for Power industry Automation Systems is being developed using several guiding principles, including the use of
              cross-platform Docker-based microservices along with a lightweight browser client, multiple language support for the user interface, scriptable
              controls, and the ability to integrate third-party tools.

              Grid eXchange Fabric (GXF) is a software platform that enables hardware monitoring and control in the public space. GXF provides several functions
              out of the box and provides scalability & high availability, high security, a generic design, and no vendor lock-in. GXF is currently deployed in
              several public use cases, including microgrids, smart metering, public lighting, and distribution automation.


              GXF is open, independent, and driven by its community, developed using open source best practices and designed to use open standards. This enables
              third parties to develop new and innovative solutions. The trade-off is flexibility and freedom. Unlike closed proprietary software, open source
              software can be altered and extended by any developer familiar with the source code. This grants organizations freedom from “vendor lock-in,”
              assures long-term viability, and creates industry opportunities for support, consulting, and training.

              PowSyBl (Power System Blocks) is an open source library dedicated to electrical grid modeling and simulation. PowSyBl is written in Java and
              licensed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0.


              PowSyBl may be scripted for a quick solution, but it can also be used as a library to write complex software for power system simulation and
              analysis. Using PowSyBl, developers can create applications able to perform dynamic power flow simulations and security analyses on the network,
              handle a variety of formats including CGMES for European data exchanges, and many other tasks.


              PowSyBl has a completely modular design, enabling developers to extend or customize its features by providing their own plugins. Modularity is a

              SEAPATH, Software Enabled Automation Platform and Artifacts (THerein), aims at developing a “reference design” and “industrial grade” open source
              real-time platform that can run virtualized automation and protection applications (for the power grid industry in the first place and potentially
              beyond). This platform is intended to host multi-provider applications.

              Focused specifically on the exchange of flexibility between Aggregators (AGRs), DSOs, and TSOs, Shapeshifter describes the corresponding market
              interactions between them to resolve grid constraints by applying congestion management or grid-capacity management. Shapeshifter can be used as a
              stand-alone protocol for flexibility forecasting, offering, ordering, and settlement processes. Its purpose is to support the use of flexibility
              markets for grid-congestion issues and standardize the setup and operation of these markets across different DSOs, TSO’s and different countries.

            description: >-
              SOGNO aims at facilitating the transition to a modular microservices based control center software solution. This allows operators to adapt faster
              because components can be updated more independently from each other. It provides system operators and automation software developers with an open
              source framework that exposes open APIs to plug in new automation functions and supports industry standards such as CIM IEC61970. The vision is to
              integrate today’s SCADA systems with SOGNO and gradually move functionalities into microservices.
